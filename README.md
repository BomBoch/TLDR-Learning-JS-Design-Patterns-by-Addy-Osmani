# Anti-Patterns
- Bad solution to a particular problem. 
- Knowledge of anti-patterns is critical for success. Once we are able to recognize such anti-patterns, we're able to refactor our code to negate them so that the overall quality of our solutions improves instantly.

# Categories Of Design Pattern
### Structural
Creational design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in.

Patterns: *Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton and Builder*

### Creational
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects.

Patterns:  *Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor*

### Behavioral
Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.

Patterns: *Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor*
